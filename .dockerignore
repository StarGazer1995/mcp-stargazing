src/data/objects.json # We might want to generate this in the build, or copy it if it exists? 
# Actually, if we run the script in the build, we don't strictly need to copy the local one. 
# But usually copying the local one is faster if the user already has it.
# However, for a reproducible build, we should generate it or assume the source has it.
# The user's request implies automation, so generating it in the build is safer.
# So I will ignore the local objects.json to ensure the image is self-contained and generated from source script.
